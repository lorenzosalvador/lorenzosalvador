# Lorenzo Salvador, DPhil Candidate | Translational Pharmacology and Molecular Antagonist Design

## About Me

I am a highly driven, late-stage PhD candidate focusing on **Translational Pharmacology** and the **design of novel molecular antagonists (antidotes)**. My academic journey is defined by a commitment to bridging fundamental molecular science with urgent clinical needs, specifically by creating targeted therapeutic solutions.

My deep commitment to this research was initially forged by a significant **family challenge** that underscored the critical need for effective, fast-acting clinical antidotes. This personal experience became the powerful motivation that propelled me through an intensive, accelerated academic path—from foundational training in Milan to advanced research at Imperial College London, culminating in my doctoral research at Oxford.

My expertise spans high-level molecular design, intensive research methodology (validated by an MRes thesis), and translational development. My goal is clear: to take a theoretical molecular concept and, through rigorous science, evolve it into a **clinically viable candidate**. I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in acute care pharmacology and contributing to a paradigm shift in how molecular interventions are applied to urgent medical scenarios.
